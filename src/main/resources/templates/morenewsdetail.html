                        <p>President Trump announced that the US will begin injecting Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine within 24 hours of FDA approval for emergency use.

                            "The first dose of vaccine will be available in less than 24 hours. We have begun shipping vaccines to every state and region in the territory, in partnership with FedEx and UPS. Elderly, healthcare staff. and quick response forces will be given priority,
                            "US President Donald Trump said on the evening of December 11 (December 12 morning Hanoi).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The announcement was made by Trump after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today urgently approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine. "This will dramatically reduce hospitalizations and deaths," Trump said.

                            In July, the US government reached a deal worth $ 1.95 billion to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer vaccine, enough to use about 50 million people. This is considered the largest vaccine deal ever. The US Department of Health and Human Services said it
                            would launch a campaign to vaccinate completely free for citizens.

                        <p>
                            The US expects to give Covid-19 vaccine to about 20 million people in December. The US government on December 11 said it was buying an additional 100 million doses of vaccine developed by Moderna, while some sources said officials had ordered. additional
                            goods vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Moderna deal increased the number of US vaccines ordered by the company to 200 million, enough to inject 100 million people according to the two-prong regimen, although officials have not yet approved the use of the company's vaccine.

                            Covid-19 broke out in December 2019, appeared in 218 countries and territories with more than 71 million cases and nearly 1.6 million deaths. The United States is the world's largest epidemic zone with more than 16 million people infected with nCoV, of

                            The pandemic caused countries to put unprecedented resources to develop vaccines in the fastest time. Britain became the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine on December 2 and began the vaccination on December 8. Bahrain and Canada are the next
                            countries, respectively, to approve the Pfizer vaccine on December 4 and December 10. Canadians can get the vaccine next week.
