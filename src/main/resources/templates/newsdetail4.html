                            The dismissal plan was disclosed in the filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on November 25. Thus, the new plan has increased by 4,000 positions to be cut from the number 28,000 announced in September 2020. According to the most recent
                            annual report, Disney employs about 223,000 employees.

                            Disney also warned that it could be forced to stop future dividends, reduce or not pay retirement and medical retirement payments. The company may also cut investments in television and movie products, and increase layoffs or lay off more employees.

                            The pandemic severely affected Disney's park business, with more than 100,000 employees in the United States. The company also had to stop the cruise ship business and postpone release of major movies, such as "Black Widow", which is expected to be one
                            of the biggest blockbusters of the year.

                            One bright spot for the company was online TV service Disney +, which now has 74 million subscribers and has become a focus of business after overhauling its media and entertainment division. CEO Bob Chapek said last week that running this business is
                            "key" to the company's future.
