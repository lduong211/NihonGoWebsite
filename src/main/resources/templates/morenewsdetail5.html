                        <p>
                            However, the sharp decline in liquidity in the last session of the week caused concerns about short-term prospects.

                            SSI's report said that short-term unexpectedly correcting risks still exist. "The bullish momentum of the market is quite good when the VN-Index surged and surpassed the previous peak. However, the sharp decline in trading volume is a signal that the
                            market is cautious as the VN-Index moves forward. near the resistance area of ​​1,050 points ", the report stated.

                            With the same point of view, KB Vietnam Securities Company also stated that the point to observe more at this time is that the trading volume is tending to decrease, although the index continues to surpass its peak. "If this does not improve in the next
                            sessions, the VN-Index is likely to enter the knee correction soon, with greater pressure after the last beat", according to KB Vietnam expert.

                        <p>
                            From a more positive view, MB Securities Company (MBS) analyzed, the market liquidity cooled down but remained at a high level. Meanwhile, foreign investors kept their trading rhythm positive. Technically, MBS believes that the VN-Index has a potential
                            to extend its upturn momentum towards the resistance zone of 1,064-1,080 points this week.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "The circulation of cash flow in leading stocks and pillars is a sign that the market is strong. Besides, the net buying of foreign investors in recent weeks may be possible. is considered to be the driving force for the market, "reported by MBS.

                        <p>
